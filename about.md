We are interested in the evolution and assembly of photosynthetic apparatus in plants. In particular, we focus on the C<sub>4</sub> leaf, where photosynthesis is strictly compartmented between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells.

C<sub>4</sub> leaves have higher photosynthetic capacities than those of C<sub>3</sub> species, and as a consequence, C<sub>4</sub> crops are the most productive on the planet. Because C4 plants have less RuBisCO protein and use PEPC, which has a high affinity for HCO<sub>3</sub><super>-</super>, they have higher nitrogen and water use efficiencies. They are therefore targets for future food and fuel needs. In collaboration with the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines, and other partners we are members of an [international consortium](http://c4rice.irri.org/) that aims to intiate work on this Grand Challenge.

The work that the laboratory has undertaken has been recognised in various ways, including [the Melvin Calvin award for research in photosynthesis](http://www.photosynthesisresearch.org/Default.aspx?pageId=216518). This international award is presented once every three years to recognise a substantial contribution to understanding photosynthesis. The specific aims of placing characteristics of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis into rice has been recognised by Nature, - see [the orignal article](http://www.nature.com/news/2008/081203/full/456563a.html) and commentaries at [Cambridge Network](http://www.cambridgenetwork.co.uk/news/article/default.aspx?objid=54472) and [BBSRC](http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/media/news/2008/081205_plant_scientists_change_world.html).

We are also currently using pairs of phylogenetically close species (rice and maize, and Arabidopsis and Cleome), to gain mechanistic insight into how the C<sub>4</sub> pathway operates, and also how it evolved. Maize and rice are useful models as crop species, while Cleome is useful because of its relatedness to Arabidopsis.

The approaches we take include, but are not limited to: standard biochemical and microbiological techniques; molecular cloning and standard molecular biological techniques; the use of molecular genetics and mutants to discover gene function; the use of transgenic plants (e.g for RNAi, antisense, overexpression and expression of reporter genes); imaging of GFP-tagged proteins to determine cellular and subcellular location, using epifluorescence or laser confocal scanning microscopy: and, using infra red gas analysis and pulse modulated fluorimetry to investigate different photosynthetic abilities, bioinformatics pipelines and computational development for analysing rich datasets.
