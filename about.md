## Our focus

We are interested in the evolution and assembly of photosynthetic apparatus in plants. In particular, we focus on the C<sub>4</sub> leaf, where photosynthesis is compartmented between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells.

## C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis
<img src="http://www.nature.com/scitable/content/ne0000/ne0000/ne0000/ne0000/13311179/taub_figure2_ksm.jpg" align="right" style='padding: 20px;'>

C<sub>4</sub> leaves have higher photosynthetic capacities than those of C<sub>3</sub> species, and as a consequence, C<sub>4</sub> crops are the most productive on the planet. Because C<sub>4</sub> plants use the PEPC enzyme to initially fix carbon, and it has a higher affinity for carbon than RuBisCO, these species maintain lower stomatal conductances. Furthermore, as RuBisCO only accumulates in BS cells, each leaf has less RuBisCO protein. Together this leads to C<sub>4</sub> plants having superior nitrogen and water use efficiencies than C<sub>3</sub> species. They are therefore targets for future food and fuel needs. 

In collaboration with the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines, and other partners we are members of an [international consortium](http://c4rice.irri.org/) that aims to intiate work on this Grand Challenge. In addition to the collaborative work on C<sub>4</sub> rice, we also have strong collaborations with a number of other groups around the world.

We are also currently using pairs of phylogenetically close species (rice and maize, and *Arabidopsis* and *Cleome*), to gain mechanistic insight into how the C<sub>4</sub> pathway operates, and also how it evolved. Maize and rice are useful models as crop species, while *Cleome* is useful because of its relatedness to *Arabidopsis*.

## Our approach

The approaches we take include, but are not limited to: standard biochemical and microbiological techniques; molecular cloning and standard molecular biological techniques; the use of molecular genetics and mutants to discover gene function; the use of transgenic plants (e.g for RNAi, antisense, overexpression and expression of reporter genes); imaging of GFP-tagged proteins to determine cellular and subcellular location, using epifluorescence or laser confocal scanning microscopy, using infra red gas analysis and pulse modulated fluorimetry to investigate different photosynthetic abilities; and, bioinformatics pipelines and computational development for analysing rich datasets.

## International recognition

The work that the laboratory has undertaken has been recognised in various ways, including [the Melvin Calvin award for research in photosynthesis](http://www.photosynthesisresearch.org/Default.aspx?pageId=216518). This international award is presented once every three years to recognise a substantial contribution to understanding photosynthesis. The specific aims of placing characteristics of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis into rice has been recognised by Nature, - see [the orignal article](http://www.nature.com/news/2008/081203/full/456563a.html) and commentaries at [Cambridge Network](http://www.cambridgenetwork.co.uk/news/article/default.aspx?objid=54472) and [BBSRC](http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/media/news/2008/081205_plant_scientists_change_world.html).
