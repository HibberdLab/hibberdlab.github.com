# Current research focus

Our work on understanding the C<sub>4</sub> pathway makes use of model organisms as well as natural variation, and     classical molecular biology approaches as well as emerging technologies in bioinformatics and computational processing.

    <p>With Andreas Weberâ€™s lab we initially conducted analysis of RNA populations in whole leaves of C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> <i>Cleome</i> species. We are extending this to undertake large-scale analysis of many more lineages, of leaf maturation, and of mesophyll and bundle sheath transcriptomes. To fully understand these large dataset, significant investment in development of computational approaches is required!</p>

    <h3>The ancestral role of proteins used in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis</h3>

    <p>Despite having well-characterised functions in C<sub>4</sub> species, many of the core enzymes of the C<sub>4</sub> pathway have poorly understood roles in C3 plants. We are analyzing the roles that they play through analysis of when and where they are expressed, as well as the use of insertional mutants and overexpression, followed by in depth photosynthetic and metabolic phenotyping. Many of these proteins are members of multi-gene families, and belong to redundant networks, and so the analysis is often intellectually challenging.</p>

    <h3>The C<sub>4</sub> rice project</h3>

    <p>Our focus has been generating resources that allow us to test the extent to which the basic C<sub>4</sub> cycle can be installed in rice. This has involved analysis of the extent to which C<sub>4</sub> genes from maize are expressed in a cell specific manner in rice, and also investigating potential regulators of these genes. Clearly, this is a long-term, incredibly challenging project, but we are finding that we learn a lot about the fundamentals of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis along the way.</p>

    <h3>Using synthetic approaches to increase CO<sub>2</sub> supply to RuBisCO</h3>

    <p>For many decades, work has been conducted that aims to increase the efficiency of RuBisCO by modifying its catalytic characteristics. We are taking an alternate approach inspired by Synthetic Biology in order to investigate whether artificial protein scaffolds can be used to improve the efficiency of photosynthesis. We hope that we can use this as proof of concept for engineering plant metabolism in general.</p>

    <h3>Overcoming the domestication bottleneck in rice</h3>

    <p>A significant amount of work has been undertaken in which individual wild relatives of rice have been used as sources for useful traits in domesticated rice. In this project we are broadening this concept to source variation present in all the AA rice genomes, and increase it further using the multi advance generation intercrossing approach. Back crossing into <i>O. sativa</i> allows useful traits to transferred into elite germplasm. The wide crossing, and the subsequent analysis of gene expression and genomic structures represent significant technical and computational challenges.</p>
