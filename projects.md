          <p>For example, we have recently undertaken a significant amount of deep sequencing of closely related C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> species, and using our leaf rolling method, generated cell specific transcriptomes for C<sub>4</sub> leaves.  This has allowed us to initiate an understanding of the extent to which the M and BS transcriptomes are convergent in independent lineages of C<sub>4</sub> plants.  This approach has also provided for the first time emerging lists of putative regulators for C<sub>4</sub> gene expression .</p>

    <h3 class="media-heading">The regulation of genes in C<sub>4</sub></h3>

    <p>Using closely related C3 and C4 plants we have identified cis-regulatory elements
    that are shared between C4 genes and lineages, and also found that these elements
    already exist in C3 genes. This may have facilitated the evolution of C4
    photosynthesis, and so may inform approaches to engineer this pathway into C3
    crops.</p>

    <h3>Using natural variation to understand C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis</h3>

    <p>Deep sequencing technologies have allowed us to map global patterns of gene
    expression in 15 of the 18 families containing C4 plants. We are particularly
    interested in defining the core set of genes required for C4 photosynthesis.</p>
