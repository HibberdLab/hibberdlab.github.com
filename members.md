# Group members

Julian established his laboratory in the Department of Plant Sciences at the University of Cambridge in 2001.  Since then, nine post-
doctoral researchers, thirteen PhD students, and three research assistants have been part of the lab.  The group is currently nine-
strong. Read more about them below.

      <h4 class="media-heading">Julian Hibberd</h4>
      <p>Julian did his PhD with John Farrar and Bob Whitbread at Bangor University.  He then moved to post-doctoral positions with Julie 
      Scholes, Paul Quick and Malcolm Press in Sheffield, and then John Gray in Cambridge.  He started his own group in Cambridge while 
      holding a BBSRC Sir David Phillips Fellowship. His interests in plant biology have focussed on various aspects of photosynthesis.
      </p>
      <p>Julian has more recently become interested in using natural variation to improve our understanding of complex traits.  He is a 
      team leader within both the C<sub>4</sub> Rice Project, and represents the photosynthesis and metabolism community on the Plant 
      Section committee of the <a href="http://www.sebiology.org">Society of Experimental Biology</a>.  He is also an <a 
      href="http://www.plantphysiol.org/site/misc/edboard.xhtml">Associate Editor</a> of <a href="http://www.plantphysiol.org"><i>Plant 
      Physiology</i></a>, and from 2011-2014 was a member of the <a href="http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/home/home.aspx">BBSRC</a> Responsive 
      Mode Grants panel.</p>

      <h4 class="media-heading">Steven Burgess</h4>
      <p>Steven graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a BSc in Biochemistry in
      2007. From 2007-2011 he undertook a PhD at Imperial College London investigating
      the use of RNAi as a means of remodelling metabolic pathways 
      in the model alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> for biofuel production.</p>
      <p>In 2011 he moved to the University of Cambridge, and is currently investigating the
      evolution of cis-regulatory networks controlling cell-specific gene
      expression in C<sub>4</sub> plants.</p>

      <h4 class="media-heading">Marek Szecowka</h4>
      <p>Marek’s PhD at the Max Plank Institute, Golm, focussed on the primary carbon metabolism of both heterotrophic and
      autotrophic tissue. He developed in vivo methods for metabolic flux studies using stable carbon isotope (<sup>13</sup>C)
      in combination with MS analytical methods. He also studied the influence of mitochondrial metabolism on the rate of
      starch biosynthesis in potato tubers.</p>
      <p>He is currently working on using artificial scaffolds to increase photosynthetic efficiency in C<sub>3</sub>
      plants.</p>

      <p>Ivan did his BSc in Biology at UNAM (Mexico) and then an MSc in Biochemistry at the same university. He is interested
      in the evolution of transcriptional regulation, especially in understanding the changes (both in <i>cis</i> and
      <i>trans</i>) required to acquire the C<sub>4</sub> pathway.</p>

    <div class="media-body">
      <h4 class="media-heading">Greg Reeves</h4>
      <p> Greg has a BSc in Genetics and MSc in Horticulture both from New Mexico State University where he studied the inheritance of 
      disease resistance and spicy flavour in chilli peppers. He discovered a new gene that inhibits disease resistance, helped sequence 
      the chilli pepper genome and developed one of the hottest peppers in the world. Additionally, he helped identify novel genes 
      involved in photosynthesis from large-scale mutant screening in green algae at the Carnegie Institute for Science, Stanford. At 
      Cambridge, he is investigating the genetic basis for C4 photosynthesis from natural variation among C4 plants and traditional gene 
      mapping approaches to identify which genes are involved in developing the C<sub>4</sub> pathway.</p>

      <p>Jane is improving our transformation of <i>Cleome gynandra</i> and is focussing on assessing elements that generate
      expression in BS cells of C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> plants. She previously worked in James Hartwell's lab in
      Liverpool on Crassulacean Acid Metabolism.</p>
