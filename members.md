# Group members

Julian established his laboratory in the Department of Plant Sciences at the University of Cambridge in 2001.  Since then, nine post-doctoral researchers, thirteen PhD students, and three research assistants have been part of the lab.  The group is currently 12-strong. Read more about them below.

      <h4 class="media-heading">Julian Hibberd</h4>
      <p>Julian did his PhD with John Farrar and Bob Whitbread at Bangor University.  He then moved to post-doctoral positions with Julie Scholes, Paul Quick and Malcolm Press in Sheffield, and then John Gray in Cambridge.  He started his own group in Cambridge while holding a BBSRC Sir David Phillips Fellowship. His interests in plant biology have focussed on various aspects of photosynthesis.</p>

      <p>Julian has more recently become interested in using natural variation to improve our understanding of complex traits.  He is a team leader within both the C<sub>4</sub> Rice Project, and the EU 3to4 FP7 programme, and represents the photosynthesis and metabolism community on the Plant Section committee of the <a href="http://www.sebiology.org">Society of Experimental Biology</a>.  He is also an <a href="http://www.plantphysiol.org/site/misc/edboard.xhtml">Associate Editor</a> of <a href="http://www.plantphysiol.org"><i>Plant Physiology</i></a>, and is a member of the <a href="http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/home/home.aspx">BBSRC</a> Responsive Mode Grants panel.</p>

      <h4 class="media-heading">Helen Woodfield</h4>
      Helen's PhD has been focussed in two areas. First, she has been involved in providing maize genes to the C<sub>4</sub> rice project, and investigating the expression of these maize genes in rice. Second, she has been investigating how bundle sheath specificity is generated in ancestral C<sub>3</sub> species.

      <h4 class="media-heading">Chris John</h4>
      <p>Chris studied at Sheffield University from 2005 to 2008 and graduated with a BSc in Biochemistry; after a few years of travelling and looking for PhD positions he found Julian's lab and decided to join in 2011. He was always particularly interested in plant molecular biology and the physical sciences during his degree. Now he is pursuing a combination of molecular biology and computational work.</p>
      <p>Chris is involved experimentally in high throughput RNA seq workflows and downstream statistical analysis of the data. He carries this out alongside molecular biology techniques such as Gibson assembly, transient and stable transformation, and motif searching in order to understand the mechanisms controlling C<sub>4</sub> gene cell specificity. He is enjoying programming in R, BASH, and Python.</p>

      <p>Richard has previously worked as a software developer, and took his BSc in Conservation Biology at the University of the West of England. He spent a sandwich year researching seed dormancy at the Millennium Seed Bank, and continued to work for the MSB as a data analyst during the final year of his degree.</p>
      <p>His PhD, funded jointly by the MSB and the Department of Plant Sciences, focuses on combining computational and molecular tools to understand how C<sub>4</sub> operates in wetland conditions such as those found in rice paddies. His approach involves using cell-type specific and developmental deep sequencing in the C<sub>4</sub> weed of rice paddies, <i>Echinochloa glabrescens</i>. Richard is currently developing software for improving high throughput sequence analysis, especially <i>de-novo</i> transcriptomics and RNA-Seq.</p>
