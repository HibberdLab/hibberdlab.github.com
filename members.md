      <h4 class="media-heading">Julian Hibberd</h4>
      <p>Julian did his PhD with John Farrar and Bob Whitbread at Bangor University.  He then moved to post-doctoral positions with Julie 
      Scholes, Paul Quick and Malcolm Press in Sheffield, and then John Gray in Cambridge.  He started his own group in Cambridge while 
      holding a BBSRC Sir David Phillips Fellowship. His interests in plant biology have focussed on various aspects of photosynthesis.
      </p>
      <p>Julian has more recently become interested in using natural variation to improve our understanding of complex traits.  He is a 
      team leader within both the C<sub>4</sub> Rice Project, and represents the photosynthesis and metabolism community on the Plant 
      Section committee of the <a href="http://www.sebiology.org">Society of Experimental Biology</a>.  He is also an <a

As a postdoc in jane Langdale’s lab at the University of Oxford (2011-2017) Andy worked to investigate the evolution of plant shoots, helping to establish a transgenic system for the candidate model fern Ceratopteris richardii via microparticle bombardment and then using this system to study the regulatory functions of the plant hormone auxin and the transcription factor LEAFY in the fern shoot.  Andy joined the Hibberd lab in May 2017 as part of a project to understand the differential regulation of chloroplast development between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells in rice (Oryza sativa).</p>

After graduation, he took an intern in Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology & Ecology for 6 months investigating the functional targets of secondary metabolites by chemical proteomics. Zhengao joined the Hibberd lab in Sep 2017 as a PhD student. He is now studying how modifications to the spatial organisation of metabolic pathways can be used to manipulate their efficiency in two complementary strands of research. In the first, he aims to better understand how assembly of synthetic protein scaffolds affects pathway efficiency in plants. In the second, he aims to increase the distance between enzymes of photosynthesis by engineering a synthetic C<sub>4</sub> cycle in leaves of C<sub>3</sub> <i>A. thaliana</i>.</p>
