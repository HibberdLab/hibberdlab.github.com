      <h4 class="media-heading">Julian Hibberd</h4>
      <p>Julian did his PhD with John Farrar and Bob Whitbread at Bangor University.  He then moved to post-doctoral positions with Julie 
      Scholes, Paul Quick and Malcolm Press in Sheffield, and then John Gray in Cambridge.  He started his own group in Cambridge while 
      holding a BBSRC Sir David Phillips Fellowship. His interests in plant biology have focussed on various aspects of photosynthesis.
      </p>
      <p>Julian has more recently become interested in using natural variation to improve our understanding of complex traits.  He is a 
      team leader within both the C<sub>4</sub> Rice Project, and represents the photosynthesis and metabolism community on the Plant 
      Section committee of the <a href="http://www.sebiology.org">Society of Experimental Biology</a>.  He is also an <a 
      href="http://www.plantphysiol.org/site/misc/edboard.xhtml">Associate Editor</a> of <a href="http://www.plantphysiol.org"><i>Plant 
      Physiology</i></a>, and from 2011-2014 was a member of the <a href="http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/home/home.aspx">BBSRC</a> Responsive

He is using his past experience to shed light on the transcriptional regulation of chloroplast biogenesis, by performing cell type-specific analyses comparing mesophyll and bundle sheath cells. He did his PhD in Rob White’s lab at the University of Cambridge where he worked on the Drosophila spermatogenesis cell differentiation pathway and developed an experimental framework for genome-wide epigenetic profiling of individual cell stages of the Drosophila male germline.</p>

      <p>Pallavi did a PhD in 2015 at National Institute of Plant Genome Research, India. She worked on investigating the role of Mitogen       Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling networks in imparting flooding tolerance in rice. In October 2015, she moved as a post-         doctoral associate to Cornell University, US, where her research interests focused on the interaction of rice with its bacterial         pathogen Xanthomonas and the role of transcription activator-like (TAL) effector proteins facilitating this interplay.
      In 2017 she started a post-doctoral position at the University of Cambridge, and is currently working on elucidating the spectrum         of regulatory networks governing the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis.</p>

This work identified a novel ABA regulator that was likely important in plant's conquest of land. After           leaving the north for warmer climes, Sean joined the Hibberd lab at the start of 2017. He will be using another bryophyte model           (Marchantia this time) to study light signalling and regulation and how this is integrated in early plant development and                 photosynthesis.</p>

      <p> Greg has a BSc in Genetics and MSc in Horticulture both from New Mexico State University where he studied the inheritance of 
      disease resistance and spicy flavour in chilli peppers. He discovered a new gene that inhibits disease resistance, helped sequence 
      the chilli pepper genome and developed one of the hottest peppers in the world. Additionally, he helped identify novel genes 
      involved in photosynthesis from large-scale mutant screening in green algae at the Carnegie Institute for Science, Stanford. At 
      Cambridge, he is investigating the genetic basis for C4 photosynthesis from natural variation among C4 plants and traditional gene 
      mapping approaches to identify which genes are involved in developing the C<sub>4</sub> pathway.</p>
