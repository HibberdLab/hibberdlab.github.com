      <h4 class="media-heading">Julian Hibberd</h4>
      <p>Julian did his PhD with John Farrar and Bob Whitbread at Bangor University.  He then moved to post-doctoral positions with Julie 
      Scholes, Paul Quick and Malcolm Press in Sheffield, and then John Gray in Cambridge.  He started his own group in Cambridge while 
      holding a BBSRC Sir David Phillips Fellowship. His interests in plant biology have focussed on various aspects of photosynthesis.
      </p>
      <p>Julian has more recently become interested in using natural variation to improve our understanding of complex traits.  He is a 
      team leader within both the C<sub>4</sub> Rice Project, and represents the photosynthesis and metabolism community on the Plant 
      Section committee of the <a href="http://www.sebiology.org">Society of Experimental Biology</a>.  He is also an <a

      <p>Pallavi did a PhD in 2015 at National Institute of Plant Genome Research, India. She worked on investigating the role of Mitogen       Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling networks in imparting flooding tolerance in rice. In October 2015, she moved as a post-         doctoral associate to Cornell University, US, where her research interests focused on the interaction of rice with its bacterial         pathogen Xanthomonas and the role of transcription activator-like (TAL) effector proteins facilitating this interplay.
      In 2017 she started a post-doctoral position at the University of Cambridge, and is currently working on elucidating the spectrum         of regulatory networks governing the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis.</p>

      <p>Sean got his PhD from the University of Leeds where he studied abscisic acid (ABA) signalling in the model bryophyte                   Physcomitrella patens. This work identified a novel ABA regulator that was likely important in plant's conquest of land. After           leaving the north for warmer climes, Sean joined the Hibberd lab at the start of 2017. He will be using another bryophyte model           (Marchantia this time) to study light signalling and regulation and how this is integrated in early plant development and                 photosynthesis.</p>

      <h4 class="media-heading">Natasha Elina</h4>
      <p>Natasha's aim is to understand the assembly of the photosynthetic apparatus and then manipulate it to induce chloroplast development in cells that are not normally green with the overarching aim to increase photosynthetic efficiency and crop productivity. Studies in Arabidopsis thaliana provide good understanding of how photosynthetic apparatus in assembled, however, this knowledge is not easily translated into grasses (including a staple monocot crop, rice). This is due to a number of whole genome duplication events and a whole genome triplication event that separate grasses from Arabidopsis. She is using a liverwort, Marchantia polymorpha, which, due to a low complexity of its genome, is an excellent tool to gain understanding of the basic ancestral pathways of the photosynthetic machinery development enabling translation of this knowledge into monocot crops.</p>

      <p>Patrick did his PhD with Phil Wigge at the Sainsbury Laboratory Cambridge University working on how plants sense temperature and how temperature is integrated with other environmental signals to control adaptive responses in Arabidopsis. This work found a role for chloroplast signalling in controlling diurnal patterns of thermotolerance. Since moving across Cambridge to the Hibberd lab in summer 2017, Patrick is working on how cell-type sepcific expression is controlled in <i>Arabidopsis</i> and how large increases in the expression of genes required for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis have evolved using <i>Arabidopsis</i> and the C<sub>4</sub> model species <i>Gynandropsis gynandra</i>. </p>

      <p>Leonie did her PhD with Professor Giles Oldroyd at the John Innes Centre in Norwich, where she investigated the downstream transcriptional targets of three GRAS-domain transcription factors required for the establishment of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in the model legume <i>Medicago truncatula</i>. Her work identified a lipid biosynthesis pathway that is upregulated in root cells colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and provides the obligate biotrophic fungus with fatty acids as a major carbon source. In November 2017, Leonie joined the Hibberd lab as a postdoctoral scientist. Her research focuses on understanding the cell type specific regulation of photosynthetic capacity in rice leaves. </p>

      <h4 class="media-heading">Kumari Billakurthi</h4>
      <p>Kumari got her PhD in December 2018 from Heinrich Heine University, Germany. She had performed EMS mutagenesis and activation tagging screens in Arabidopsis thaliana and had analysed comparative transcriptomics of leaf developmental gradients from C3 and C4 Flaveria species to identify novel genes that determine C4 leaf anatomy. She then continued in the same group as a postdoctoral researcher until the end of 2019. In April 2020, she has joined the Hibberd’s group as a research associate to investigate how chloroplasts biogenesis is regulated by cell division patterns in rice (Oryza sativa) bundle sheath cells.</p>

      <h4 class="media-heading">Tina B. Schreier</h4>
      <p>Tina did her PhD in plant biochemistry at ETH Zurich, and her main research interest lies in plant metabolism and photosynthesis. She joined the lab of Julian Hibberd in October 2018 as a Swiss National Science Foundation Research Fellow, studying cell-to-cell connectivity in leaves of the <i>Cleome</i> family and how this trait might have facilitated the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. During her PhD in the lab of Professor Sam Zeeman, she discovered two chloroplast proteins that were originally thought to act as enzymes play other important non-canonical roles. This includes the plastidial NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase, where the protein but not the enzymatic activity is required for proper chloroplast development. After her PhD, she worked at the John Innes Centre in the group of Professor Alison Smith, studying transgenic wheat lines with altered carbohydrate metabolism in the grain.</p>

Zhengao joined the Hibberd lab in Sep 2017 as a PhD student. He is now studying how modifications to the spatial organisation of metabolic pathways can be used to manipulate their efficiency in two complementary strands of research. In the first, he aims to better understand how assembly of synthetic protein scaffolds affects pathway efficiency in plants. In the second, he aims to increase the distance between enzymes of photosynthesis by engineering a synthetic C<sub>4</sub> cycle in leaves of C<sub>3</sub> <i>A. thaliana</i>.</p>

      and number of genes responsible for certain C<sub>4</sub> characteristics. Additionally, with the aim of identifying loci responsible for complex
