      <h4 class="media-heading">Julian Hibberd</h4>
      <p>Julian did his PhD with John Farrar and Bob Whitbread at Bangor University. He then moved to post-doctoral positions with Julie Scholes, Paul  Quick and Malcolm Press in Sheffield, and then John Gray in Cambridge. He started his own group in Cambridge while holding a BBSRC Sir David Phillips Fellowship. Julian’s interests in plant biology have focussed on various aspects of photosynthesis, but most work relates to the evolution and function of the C4 pathway.</p>
      <p>Julian represented the photosynthesis and metabolism community from 2005-2012 on the Plant Section committee of the <a href="http://www.sebiology.org">Society of Experimental Biology</a>, and in 2013 was elected as a European Representative of the International Photosynthesis Society. He has served on numerous BBSRC committees, and from 2012-2022 was an Associate Editor of <a href="http://www.plantphysiol.org"><i>Plant Physiology</i></a>. Julian is currently a team leader within both the C4 Rice Project, on the Management Board of the Sainsbury Laboratory Cambridge University, and is Head of the Plant Sciences Department.</p>

      <p>Kumari got her PhD in December 2018 from Heinrich Heine University, Germany. She had performed EMS mutagenesis and activation tagging screens in Arabidopsis thaliana and had analysed comparative transcriptomics of leaf developmental gradients from C3 and C4 Flaveria species to identify novel genes that determine C4 leaf anatomy. She then continued in the same group as a postdoctoral researcher until the end of 2019. In April 2020, she has joined the Hibberd’s group as a research associate to investigate how chloroplasts biogenesis is regulated by cell division patterns in rice (Oryza sativa) bundle sheath cells.</p>     </div>

      <p>Rohan got his PhD at the University of Reading in 2023 where he studied the stability of QTL associated to bread-making quality traits and conducted a QTL analysis on the trait Grain Protein Deviation (GPD) in wheat. He also investigated the senescence dynamic in the mapping population and performed a QTL detection for senescence traits. Since April 2023, he is hosted joinly by the Hibberd and Kromdijk labs where he is finalizing the development of a <i>Cleome gynandra</i> mapping population and carrying out association analysis on <i>C. gynandra</i> photosynthetic traits.</p>

      <p> Anoop is Gates Cambridge PhD Scholar working on various aspects of grafting and somatic hybridization. Prior to this, he worked as a Senior Research Technician in the Hibberd lab where he was involved in establishing the method of monocot grafting which overturned the long-standing consensus that monocots cannot graft.  Back in India he worked as a Senior Research Fellow at the National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (ICAR-NBPGR), New Delhi, where his research focused on understanding the gene regulatory networks in cereal crops.
