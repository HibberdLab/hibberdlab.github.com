      <h4 class="media-heading">Julian Hibberd</h4>
      <p>Julian did his PhD with John Farrar and Bob Whitbread at Bangor University.  He then moved to post-doctoral positions with Julie 
      Scholes, Paul Quick and Malcolm Press in Sheffield, and then John Gray in Cambridge.  He started his own group in Cambridge while 
      holding a BBSRC Sir David Phillips Fellowship. His interests in plant biology have focussed on various aspects of photosynthesis.
      </p>
      <p>Julian has more recently become interested in using natural variation to improve our understanding of complex traits.  He is a 
      team leader within both the C<sub>4</sub> Rice Project, and represents the photosynthesis and metabolism community on the Plant 
      Section committee of the <a href="http://www.sebiology.org">Society of Experimental Biology</a>.  He is also an <a 
      href="http://www.plantphysiol.org/site/misc/edboard.xhtml">Associate Editor</a> of <a href="http://www.plantphysiol.org"><i>Plant 
      Physiology</i></a>, and from 2011-2014 was a member of the <a href="http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/home/home.aspx">BBSRC</a> Responsive

During her PhD, she identified a role for auxin and auxin-related genes during the plant response to the ionic component of salinity stress. Lee joined the Hibberd lab in March 2020. Here she will be working to identify and characterise master transcriptional regulators of photosynthesis in rice and analyse the transcriptional changes in maize bundle sheath and mesophyll cells during growth in photoinhibitory conditions. </p>

      <h4 class="media-heading">Patrick Dickinson</h4>
      <p>Patrick did his PhD with Phil Wigge at the Sainsbury Laboratory Cambridge University working on how plants sense temperature and how temperature is integrated with other environmental signals to control adaptive responses in Arabidopsis. This work found a role for chloroplast signalling in controlling diurnal patterns of thermotolerance. Since moving across Cambridge to the Hibberd lab in summer 2017, Patrick is working on how cell-type sepcific expression is controlled in <i>Arabidopsis</i> and how large increases in the expression of genes required for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis have evolved using <i>Arabidopsis</i> and the C<sub>4</sub> model species <i>Gynandropsis gynandra</i>. </p>

     <h4 class="media-heading">Kumari Billakurthi</h4>
      <p>Kumari got her PhD in December 2018 from Heinrich Heine University, Germany. She had performed EMS mutagenesis and activation tagging screens in Arabidopsis thaliana and had analysed comparative transcriptomics of leaf developmental gradients from C3 and C4 Flaveria species to identify novel genes that determine C4 leaf anatomy. She then continued in the same group as a postdoctoral researcher until the end of 2019. In April 2020, she has joined the Hibberdâ€™s group as a research associate to investigate how chloroplasts biogenesis is regulated by cell division patterns in rice (Oryza sativa) bundle sheath cells.</p>

      <h4 class="media-heading">Tina B. Schreier</h4>
      <p>Tina did her PhD in plant biochemistry at ETH Zurich, and her main research interest lies in plant metabolism and photosynthesis. She joined the lab of Julian Hibberd in October 2018 as a Swiss National Science Foundation Research Fellow, studying cell-to-cell connectivity in leaves of the <i>Cleome</i> family and how this trait might have facilitated the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. During her PhD in the lab of Professor Sam Zeeman, she discovered two chloroplast proteins that were originally thought to act as enzymes play other important non-canonical roles. This includes the plastidial NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase, where the protein but not the enzymatic activity is required for proper chloroplast development. After her PhD, she worked at the John Innes Centre in the group of Professor Alison Smith, studying transgenic wheat lines with altered carbohydrate metabolism in the grain.</p>

      <p>Zhengao did his PhD in the Hibberd lab, and is currently conitnuing his work on engineering a reverse C4 photosynthetic pathway in C3 species Arabidopsis thaliana. The reverse C4 photosynthesis system introduced C4 biochemistry in the opposite cell types from those used by C4 species, which aimed at replicating the spatial patterning of the C4 biochemical pathway and making use of the native leaf anatomy of C3 species. At the same time, he is also using betalain biosynthetic pathway to understand how the assembly of synthetic protein scaffolds could be used to improve metabolic pathway efficiency in plants.</p>
