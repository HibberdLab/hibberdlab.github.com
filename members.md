      <h4 class="media-heading">Julian Hibberd</h4>
      <p>Julian did his PhD with John Farrar and Bob Whitbread at Bangor University.  He then moved to post-doctoral positions with Julie Scholes, Paul Quick and Malcolm Press in Sheffield, and then John Gray in Cambridge.  He started his own group in Cambridge while holding a BBSRC Sir David Phillips Fellowship. His interests in plant biology have focussed on various aspects of photosynthesis.</p>

      <p>Julian has more recently become interested in using natural variation to improve our understanding of complex traits.  He is a team leader within both the C<sub>4</sub> Rice Project, and the EU 3to4 FP7 programme, and represents the photosynthesis and metabolism community on the Plant Section committee of the <a href="http://www.sebiology.org">Society of Experimental Biology</a>.  He is also an <a href="http://www.plantphysiol.org/site/misc/edboard.xhtml">Associate Editor</a> of <a href="http://www.plantphysiol.org"><i>Plant Physiology</i></a>, and is a member of the <a href="http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/home/home.aspx">BBSRC</a> Responsive Mode Grants panel.</p>

      <p>Marekâ€™s PhD at the Max Plank Institute, Golm, focussed on the primary carbon metabolism of both heterotrophic and autotrophic tissue. He developed in vivo methods for metabolic flux studies using stable carbon isotope (<sup>13</sup>C) in combination with MS analytical methods. He also studied the influence of mitochondrial metabolism on the rate of starch biosynthesis in potato tubers.</p>

      <h4 class="media-heading">Helen Woodfield</h4>
      Helen's PhD has been focussed in two areas. First, she has been involved in providing maize genes to the C<sub>4</sub> rice project, and investigating the expression of these maize genes in rice. Second, she has been investigating how bundle sheath specificity is generated in ancestral C<sub>3</sub> species.
